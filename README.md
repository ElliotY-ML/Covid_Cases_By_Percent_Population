# Overview
This repository contains codes, data, and calculated features for visualizing recent COVID-19 cases in the US.  
The generated data is utilized in Tableau Public for creating dashboards with line graphs, bar charts, and heat maps of COVID-19-19 cases and deaths.

# Introduction  
  
This project presents a different aspect than those seen on New York Times and U.S. CDC analysis by analyzing totals of new Covid-19 cases reported in the past 14 days. 
Estimates of the percentage of each state population that is currently infected with Covid-19 is calculated by normalizing the past 14 day new case totals to their respective state populations.  
The data is presented as a percentage because it may be more intuitively digested by the general population, as opposed to using a basis of per million or per thousand.

The author selected time intervals of 14-days based studies that show that an average period of COVID-19 infectiousness and risk of transmission is between 3 days before and 8 days after symptom onset, 
and COVID-19 RNA usually becomes undetectable from upper respiratory tract samples about 2 weeks after symptom onset[1, 2, 3].
